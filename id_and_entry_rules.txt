LPU ID CARD, ENTRY, TURNSTILE & MOVEMENT RULES  
(Official Guidelines – 2025–26)

=======================================================
1. STUDENT ID CARD — PURPOSE
=======================================================
The LPU Student ID Card is mandatory for:
• Entering or exiting the campus  
• Passing through turnstiles  
• Hostel entry  
• Library access  
• Mess entry  
• Examination hall entry  
• Official verification  

Every student MUST carry their ID card at all times.

=======================================================
2. TURNSTILE ENTRY SYSTEM
=======================================================
LPU uses a biometric + RFID card turnstile system.

Turnstiles are placed at:
• Main campus entry  
• Block entrances  
• Hostel blocks  

They record:
• Entry time  
• Exit time  
• Movement inside campus for safety  

Without the ID card → access is not allowed.

=======================================================
3. ID CARD ACTIVATION (NEW STUDENTS)
=======================================================
Every new student receives an ID card during induction.

Activation process:
• Card is issued with full access  
• Student must check if the card works at all turnstiles  
• If not working, visit the ID Card Help Desk  

=======================================================
4. LOST ID CARD — WHAT TO DO
=======================================================
If a student loses their ID card:

STEP 1 → Immediately inform your Hostel Warden  
STEP 2 → Warden will issue a *temporary slip*  
STEP 3 → Apply for a new ID card  

The temporary slip:
• Is valid for ONLY 2 days  
• Allows entry/exit only through security guard verification  
• Must be shown at every checkpoint  

If the card is found later, return the temporary slip.
